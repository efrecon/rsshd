# You can modify the (internal) location to store the host keys

# ENV KEYS="/etc/ssh/keys"

# By default, the container allows external clients to jump into the tunnels from
# the outside (host, for example). If you want to turn off this behaviour,
# meaning that you will have to docker exec into the container before being able
# to jump into the tunnel, you could set the following variable.
# ENV LOCAL=1

# Where to store the host keys (to arrange for proper restarts/recreations)
VOLUME /etc/ssh/keys

# Where to store the list of authorised clients (good for restarts)
VOLUME /root/.ssh
